Automobile Dataset Analysis using MySQL

** Project Overview **
This project explores the **Automobile dataset** using SQL to answer real-world business questions about pricing, performance, fuel efficiency, and market segmentation.  
The dataset contains 205 records and 26 attributes such as `make`, `fuel-type`, `engine-size`, `horsepower`, `mileage`, and `price`.
This project explores an Automobile dataset using MySQL. The goal is to practice SQL queries while answering real-world business questions such as pricing trends, brand comparisons, and fuel efficiency insights.

The project demonstrates my ability to:

Design a database schema.

Import raw CSV data into MySQL.

Write SQL queries to solve business problems.

Export results for further analysis and reporting.

** Objectives **
- Practice SQL queries on a real dataset
- Derive business insights useful for automobile manufacturers, dealerships, and customers
- Showcase SQL skills for data analysis and reporting

** Key Business Questions Solved **
1. Which manufacturers produce the most budget-friendly cars?
2. What is the average price range for different body styles (sedan, hatchback, SUV, etc.)?
3. Which manufacturer has the most expensive car and what features make it costly?
4. Do larger engines always mean higher prices?
5. Which cars offer the best horsepower-to-price ratio?
6. How do fuel types (gas vs diesel) affect average price and mileage?
7. What are the top 5 most fuel-efficient cars?
8. Which manufacturers dominate the budget, mid-range, and luxury segments?
9. What is the relationship between car weight and fuel efficiency?
10. What is the cost difference between 2-door and 4-door cars?
11. Which car body styles are most common in the dataset?
12. What is the average price and performance difference between European and Japanese manufacturers?
13. If a customer wants maximum horsepower under $20,000, which car should they buy?
14. Which manufacturer offers the widest variety of models in terms of price and performance?
15. If fuel economy is the top priority, which top 5 cars should be recommended?
16. What is the trend between car weight (curb-weight) and fuel efficiency (mpg)?
17. How much do customers need to pay extra for luxury (leather interiors, body style differences, higher cylinders)?

    I analyzed the Automobile dataset using MySQL to answer real-world business questions such as pricing strategies, fuel economy comparisons, and customer segmentation. These queries replicate the kind of insights auto manufacturers, dealerships, and market analysts would need in real scenarios.
